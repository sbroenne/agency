# Forge Quick Reference

Quick-reference guide for authoring and distribution decisions across prompts, custom agents, and agent skills.

**Concrete starter in this repo:** `squads/forge/workflows/excel-mcp-server/workflow.json` + `squads/forge/scaffolds/excel-mcp-server/` + `squads/forge/home/catalog.json`

**Boundary:** Forge knowledge stays here in `agency`; the actual working repo gets created locally when authoring starts.

## Distribution Type Decision Tree

```
┌─ What are you building?
│
├─ Reusable prompts or system instructions for agent workflows
│  └─→ PROMPT LIBRARY ✓
│      • System prompts, few-shot examples, conversation starters
│      • No agents, no skills; just guidance
│      • Share as markdown files or `.txt` prompts
│      • Example: specialized review prompt for code reviewer agent
│
├─ A custom agent persona with specialized behavior
│  └─→ CUSTOM AGENT (AGENT.md) ✓
│      • Instructions, behaviors, tool bindings
│      • Optionally paired with prompts and skills
│      • Publishable as standalone or within a distribution
│      • Example: Code Reviewer agent with review expertise
│
├─ Single reusable utility (Excel automation, JSON formatter, HTTP client, etc.)
│  └─→ LIBRARY DISTRIBUTION (Skills-Only) ✓
│      • Agent skills only, no agents/prompts
│      • No UI, purely functional
│      • Publish to npm or private registry
│      • Example: excel-mcp-server (Excel MCP Server wrapper)
│      • Example: @myorg/skill-json-parser
│
└─ Complete workflow with multiple assets (skills + agents + prompts)
   └─→ CUSTOMER-FACING DISTRIBUTION ✓
       • Skills + custom agents + system prompts
       • May include UI/UX decisions
       • Does it need complex state/routing?
       │
       ├─ No → Keep it simple, skip APM
       │   └─ Just skills, agents, and prompts
       │
       └─ Yes → Introduce APM (Advanced Plugin Management)
           └─ Handles stateful workflows, routing, persistence
```

## Agent Skill Authoring: SKILL.md Format

Forge adopts **SKILL.md** as the portable, standard format for authoring agent skills. Each skill starts with its own SKILL.md file:

```markdown
---
name: "Skill Name"
description: "One-line description"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
capabilities: ["what", "it", "enables"]
---

# Skill Name

## Overview
What it does and why it's useful.

## Usage Example
\`\`\`javascript
// Example code
\`\`\`

## Input Schema
...

## Output Schema
...
```

**Where it fits:**
- **Layer 1:** Author individual skills → each in its own `skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`
- **Layer 2:** Organize into distributions → use `plugin.json` to list skills + metadata
- **Layer 3:** Publish → package as npm module or GitHub release

**Key points:**
- SKILL.md is portable (can be understood independently, reused elsewhere)
- plugin.json coordinates skills, agents, and prompts for packaging
- Layers serve different concerns; both matter

## plugin.json Essentials

### Library Skill: Excel MCP Server Example

```json

  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "customer-facing",
  "description": "What it does",
  "maintainer": {

    }
  ]
}
```

## Status Lifecycle

```
dev ──────→ beta ──────→ stable ──────→ deprecated
(building) (testing)  (production)   (sunsetting)
```

## PLUGINS.md Statuses

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `dev` | Work in progress, not ready for use | Under development |
| `beta` | Ready for testing, may have breaking changes | Test and provide feedback |
| `stable` | Production-ready, follows semver | Use in production |
| `deprecated` | No longer maintained, avoid new usage | Migrate to replacement |

## Dev Repo Commands

```bash
# Validate all plugins
npm run validate

# Build PLUGINS.md registry
npm run build:plugins

# Run tests
npm test

# Before releasing
npm run release:check
```

## Release Checklist

- [ ] All skills pass `npm run validate`
- [ ] Tests pass: `npm test`
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with version and release notes
- [ ] Version bumped in `plugin.json` and `package.json`
- [ ] `SKILLS.md` shows new version
- [ ] Commit and tag: `git tag skill-name@1.0.0`
- [ ] Push tag to trigger CI release workflow
- [ ] Verify published to registry (npm, GitHub releases, etc.)
- [ ] Update Agency's Forge registry entry with published URL

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Library skill with agents** — Library skills must be tools-only  
✓ **Skills only in library skill**

❌ **Customer-facing skill with no agents** — Customer-facing requires at least one agent  
✓ **Customer-facing skill has agents**

❌ **Status other than dev/beta/stable/deprecated** — Invalid status value  
✓ **Status is one of the four allowed values**

❌ **Version doesn't follow semver** — Not a valid semantic version  
✓ **Version follows X.Y.Z format (e.g., 1.0.0)**

❌ **SKILLS.md drifts from reality** — stale registry entries confuse release decisions  
✓ **Either regenerate `SKILLS.md` via `npm run build:skills` or update it alongside the home tracker in lean repos**

## When to Add APM (Advanced Plugin Management)

**Add APM if your customer-facing plugin needs:**
- State persistence across calls
- Stateful workflows (e.g., multi-turn conversations)
- Complex routing between agents
- Message queue or async processing
- User session tracking
- Configuration storage per-user

**Skip APM if your plugin:**
- Runs independently with each call
- Has no state between invocations
- Just chains skills sequentially
- Only needs system prompts
